**VLCMatrix Lab Advancing Innovation in Disaster Response through AI and Satellite Imagery**

We are delighted to share another proud achievement from VLCMatrix Lab: a groundbreaking research presentation by Abdul Rehman under the supervision of Dr. Tanzila Kehkashan titled:

"CADSNet: Cross-Aligned Dual-Stream Network for Building Damage Assessment Using Disaster Satellite Imagery"

Presented at the International Conference on Computing and Algorithms (ICCA 2025)

This innovative study addresses the critical challenge of rapid and accurate building damage assessment following natural disasters. By developing a novel dual-stream architecture with deformable cross-alignment modules, CADSNet overcomes the limitations of existing approaches that struggle with image misregistration and nuanced damage classification—factors crucial for prioritizing rescue operations and efficient resource allocation.

The research leverages the xBD dataset to train a sophisticated deep learning model that processes paired pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery. CADSNet's architecture explicitly aligns features at multiple scales to counteract spatial misregistration caused by off-nadir angles and varying imaging conditions, while jointly training on building segmentation and damage categorization for superior localization accuracy.

Key Achievements:
✅ Macro-F1 score of 0.772 across all damage categories
✅ Building IoU of 0.686 for precise spatial localization
✅ Damage Average Precision of 0.880
✅ State-of-the-art performance outperforming HRTBDA, BD-SKUNet, and SDAFormer
✅ Enhanced recognition of challenging classes like minor and major damage

By integrating dual-stream ResNet34 backbones with deformable cross-alignment for robust feature fusion, this research significantly advances automated damage detection capabilities. The framework enables more reliable and timely assessment of building damages across different disaster types—from earthquakes to hurricanes—empowering disaster management agencies to make faster, data-driven decisions for rescue prioritization and resource allocation in affected areas.

This milestone reflects VLCMatrix Lab's continued commitment to pioneering interdisciplinary research that combines artificial intelligence, computer vision, and remote sensing technologies for real-world humanitarian impact.

Congratulations to Abdul Rehman, Dr. Tanzila Kehkashan, Imran Ashraf, and the entire research team including international collaborators from the University of Zagreb and University of Doha for Science and Technology for their outstanding contribution to advancing disaster response technology!
