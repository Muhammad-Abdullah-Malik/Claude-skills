## Example 1: Underwater Object Detection Research

**Post:**

VLCMatrix Lab Showcasing Research Excellence in AI and Computer Vision

We are delighted to share another proud achievement from VLCMatrix Lab: a groundbreaking research presentation by Faheem Akbar under the supervision of Dr. Tanzila Kehkashan titled:

"Underwater Object Detection with YOLO: A Recall-Centric Training Strategy"

Presented at the International Conference on Innovative Computing (ICIC 2025)
December 10, 2025

This innovative study addresses the critical challenges of underwater object detection by developing a recall-focused YOLO pipeline that minimizes false negatives while maintaining competitive accuracy. The research tackles real-world marine monitoring challenges, including wavelength-dependent attenuation, color cast, and backscatter that traditionally hamper detection systems.

Key Achievements:
✅ 83.2% mAP@0.5 on URPC2020 dataset
✅ 76.5% mAP@0.5 on cross-domain URPC2019 testing
✅ Impressive 89% recall rate with only 11% false negative rate
✅ Robust performance under domain shift without retraining

By integrating class-balanced sampling, strategic augmentation techniques, and resource-conscious training strategies, this research advances practical applications in marine ecology monitoring, aquaculture, autonomous inspection, and seabed mapping; bridging the gap between AI capabilities and real-world underwater robotics deployment.

This milestone reflects the continued commitment of VLCMatrix Lab to pioneering interdisciplinary research that combines AI, computer vision, and marine technology innovations for real-world impact.

Congratulations to Faheem Akbar, Muhammad Abdullah, and the entire research team for their outstanding contribution to advancing underwater detection technology!
